							<p> Broadly speaking, my research program is centered around the study of gravity.
							My main line of work focuses on theories of modified gravity. Generally, modified gravity (MG) refers to two things: theories whose equations of motion reduces to the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) in some limit and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). My research program is heavily geared toward the former, but with some attention paid to the latter for there are still some interesting lessons to be extracted from it.
							Why would one be interested in MG in the first place? General Relativity (GR) has made a whole host of predictions, all of which have been confirmed by observations within the solar system to exquisite detail. And yet, an entire industry of high energy theorists and cosmologists alike have been looking to modify Einstein’s theory in some way since it’s original inception 100 years ago. So, what gives? Historically, the motivation for studying MG was to better understand GR. Being able to alter and deform GR can give a substantial insight into the sensitivity of its mathematical structure. We find that there can only be very small deviations or very tight constraints that are placed on any new parameters to the theory.
							In the modern day, when asked for their motivation, theorists cite the expansion of the universe. Data gathered from Type 1a supernovae leads one to the conclusion that the universe's rate of expansion is increasing which is to say that it is accelerating exponentially. If GR is to be believed (and we have every reason to do so) then this accelerated expansion is due to the so-called Dark Energy. Reports of the rotation curves of galaxies also paint the picture that our understanding of the universe on an astronomical scale is also lacking. Additionally, the incoming deluge of data from various earth and space-based telescopes such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), James Webb Space Telescope etc. will act as a sort of probe into gravity on a length scale that has not hitherto been tested at. A proper test of gravity at cosmological scales requires us to have multiple models to compare GR to. In short, there are number of compelling reasons to look toward MG as an interesting field of study.
							My own work thus far has been on constraining these models using large galaxy clusters in large-volume simulations. Typically, cosmologists use the power spectrum as our means to understand the universe on these scales. However, since many of the MG models will only be slight deviations from GR, it may prove difficult to try and use it as a means of discriminating between models. That is why we have been centering our attention onto the mean pairwise velocity (MPV). The MPV is the average radial velocity difference along the line of sight between any pair of objects, where we average over all pairs. If the distribution of cluster velocities were random, we would anticipate this quantity to be zero. However, since gravity is an attractive force, we expect to find on average a small velocity of any pair of clusters towards each other. This makes MPV an excellent tool to test GR on scales of tens of megaparsecs.
							Within the next ten years, our instruments will have the sensitivity to detect this radial velocity using the transverse lensing signal which takes on the form of a dipole distortion of the CMB temperature, with the dipole oriented along perpendicular to the line of sight to the cluster. My most recent paper shows how with enough clusters (N~2x104 clusters) it is feasible that we could rule out the various models we have used as toy examples for our future analysis showing that not only is the MPV a good statistic to distinguish between MG models, but that using MG to test GR is a worthwhile venture to pursue.
							More recently, I have been interested in questions concerning Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). LQG is the research program concerning the quantization of gravity by recasting the variables of GR into the form of a non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and then quantizing the new gauge field and its canonical partner the 3-dimensional vierbein. Particularly, I am interested in the role that the Hamiltonian of fermionic matter may play in the quantization of gravity as well as the discovery of new normalizable wave functionals. </p>
